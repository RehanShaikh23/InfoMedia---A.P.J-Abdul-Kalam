                                After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). Under his direction, India successfully launched the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980. Kalam first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
